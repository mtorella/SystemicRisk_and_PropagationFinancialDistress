# Systemic Risk and the Propagation of Financial Distress: A Network-Based Analysis of Traditional and FinTech Ecosystems
## Thesis code
This repository contains the Python code developed for my Bachelor’s thesis in Management and Computer Science (LUISS University).
The project studies systemic financial risk using an SIIS contagion model applied to three different network structures:
- Traditional financial network
- FinTech network
- Joint (Traditional + FinTech) network
Each network has its own script and parameter configuration.

## What the code does:
- Builds synthetic financial networks (Traditional, FinTech, Joint)
- Simulates contagion using the SIIS model
- Supports different policy scenarios (baseline, risk-aware rewiring, TBTF saving)
- Generates outputs such as time-series data, failure counts, and network statistics
